							<li>the lawyer's general experience;</li>
							<li>the lawyer's training and experience in the field in question;</li>

						<h4>The Right to Conflict-Free Representation</h4>
						<p>Under the 6th Amendment:</p>
						<blockquote>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speed and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall
							have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and case of the accusation; to be confronted with the
							witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his faovr, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.</blockquote>

						<li>A lawyer has a duty of loyalty to their client, regardless of the relative strength of weakness of a client's claim. <i>Stockton v. Ford</i>, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 232 (1850).
						</li>
						<li>That duty of loyalty implies that a lawyer has a duty of advocating for their client with utmost devotion and diligence.</li>
						<li>To fulfill that duty, the lawyer must avoid conflicts of interest.</li>
						<li>In order for the duty to apply, however, there must be an attorney client relationship. <i>See Rohm and Haas Co. v. Dow Chemical Co.</i>, 2009 W.L. 445609 (Del. Ch. 2009).

											<ul>
												<li>Facts <ul>
														<li>Dow was a former client of Wachtell, which represented the company on matters substantially related to the current proceedings. Wachtell,
															however, now represented the plaintiffs, Rohm and Haas Co.</li>
														<li>Dow argues that they are currently clients of Wachtell because Wachtell did not take steps to inform Dow that it was no longer a client,
															following Wachtell's past representation.</li>
														<li>Given that Dow had provided sensitive information to Wachtell, Dow moved to disqualify Wachtell from representing Rohm and Haas Co.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Question <ul>
														<li>Should Wachtell be disqualified because of a conflict of interest?</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Analysis <ul>
														<li>No. Dow knew that Wachtell was representing Rohm and Haas Co. during the merger agreement and did not object.</li>
														<li>Why? Because if Dow truly felt that they were a current client of Wachtell, they should not have sat across the table from their own
															lawyers, and they should have objected then there.</li>
														<li>Moreover, Dow had obtained its own separate counsel during the merger agreement and did not object.</li>

											<!-- These are the facts -->
											<ul>
												<li>Facts <ul>
														<li>Plaintiffs Murray et. al. were policyholders of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metro Life"), back when the company was a mutual
															insurance company. The company is now called MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife"), the defendants.</li>
														<li>In 2000, MetroLife demutualized and turned into MetLife.</li>
														<li>Murray et. al. filed suit, alleging that they had been misled and shortchanged by the company in the demutualization transaction.</li>
														<li>9 years after the complaint was filed, and 5 weeks before trial, Murray et. al. moved to disqualify MetLife's counsel, Debevoise & Plimpton
															LLP ("Debevoise"), alleging that, since Debevoise had been Metro Life's counsel before and during demutualization, they were also Murray et.
															al.'s counsel during the the demutualization transaction.</li>
														<li>MetLife responded with the Doctrine of Laches, arguing that, as a matter of law, the policyholders of a mutual insurance company are not a
															priori the clients of that company's corporate counsel, and charged that Murray et. al.'s motion was made for improper tactical purposes.

											<!-- This the question -->
											<ul>
												<li>Question <ul>
														<li>Was Debevoise both the plaintiff and the defendant's counsel at the time of demutualization?</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
											<!-- This is the analysis -->
											<ul>
												<li>Analysis <ul>
														<li>It is well-settled law that a corporation's outside counsel represents the corporation, not its shareholders or other constituents. <i>See
																Rest. 3d of the Rule Governing Lawyers</i>, § 96 cmt. b.</li>
														<li>These rules apply as well to a mutual insurance company.</li>
														<li>Under New York Law, a "mutual insurance company is a cooperative enterprise in which the policyholders constitute the members for whose
															benefit the company is organized, maintained, and operated.</li>
														<li>Furthermore, a policyholder is in no sense a partner of the policy-issuing corporation; the policy holder's relationship to the corporation
															is purely contractual. </li>
														<li>Finally, not every beneficiary of a lawyer's advice is deemed a client. <ul>
																<li>A lawyer may provide an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for the use of <i>someone other than the client</i>, if the lawyer
																	reasonably believes that doing so is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer's relationship with the client. <i>See </i>N.Y.R.
																	Prof'l. Conduct 2.3(a).</li>

													<li>Facts <ul>
															<li>The plaintiff Beets was represented by the lawyer E. Ray Andrews ("Andrews Sr.") on the matter of murdering her husband.</li>
															<li>As payment for the representation, Andrews Sr. and Beets entered into a contract transferring all literary and media rights related to
																her case to Andrews Sr.'s son, E. Ray Andrews, Jr. ("Andrews Jr.").</li>
															<li>Beets was convicted of murder.</li>
															<li>On habeas petition, Beets asserted that the media rights contract generated a conflict of interest in violation of her 6th Amendment
																right to effective assistance of counsel at trial.</li>
															<li>The district court granted, and the State of Texas appealed.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li>Question <ul>
															<li>Whether a contract granting trial counsel media rights to her client's representation as payment of fees violates the rules of
																professional conduct, thereby creating a serious potential conflict of interest rendering ineffective assistance of counsel.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li>Analysis <ul>
															<li>Fee arrangements like that presented here have been denounced by legal community.</li>
															<li>These types of contracts are almost universally considered to be serious potential conflicts of interest.</li>
															<li>Particularly in a capital murder case, it is impermissible for trial counsel to gain his fee by marketing on the tragedy and misery of
																his client, her family, and, worst, the victim and his loved ones.</li>
															<li>But, these contracts are serious <em>potential</em> conflicts of interest, rather than <em>actual</em> conflicts of interest.</li>
															<li>Thus, to prevail on the claim that a conflict of interest rendered ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the claimant must
																demonstrate that there was an <em>actual</em> conflict of interest, and that such conflict of interest adversely affected counsel's
																performance.</li>
															<li>Beets has failed to demonstrate this requirement.</li>
															<li>The district court's decision granting the writ of habeas corpus is reversed.</li>

								<ul>
									<li>Facts <ul>
											<li>In 1968, Gulf Oil Corp. ("Gulf") retained the New Mexico law firm Bigbee, Stephenson, Carpenter & Crout ("Bigbee") to represent Gulf in its New Mexico
												uranium operations.</li>
											<li>From 1971 to 1976, Bigbee provided Gulf patenting, lease drafting, litigation, resolution counseling, and lobbying services.</li>
											<li>In 1976, Westinghouse Elec. Corp. ("Westinghouse"), a nuclear reactor manufacturer, filed suit in N.D. Ill. against several corporations, two of which
												were Gulf and United Nuclear Corporation ("UNC"). Westinghouse alleged that: <ul>
													<li>Gulf and UNC participated in an international cartel that fixed and increased uranium prices in the United States, which in turn led to their
														defaulting on uranium supply contracts.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>In response to this litigation, Bigbee represented UNC.</li>
											<li>In defense, Gulf argued that the largest supply of their uranium, the Mt. Taylor reserves, were simply not in production at the time.</li>
											<li>Gulf's defense depended on confidential information entrusted to Bigbee.</li>
											<li>However, while UNC was a co-defendant, it had interests adverse to Gulf; it sought to exculpate itself by inculpating Gulf.</li>
											<li>In light of this dilemma, Gulf moved to disqualify Bigbee.</li>
											<li>N.D. Ill. denied the motion, concluding that Bigbee's work for Gulf regarding the Mt. Taylor reserves focused on real estate transactions, rather than
												the actual amount of untapped and undeveloped uranium reserves.</li>
											<li>Gulf appealed to the 7th Cir.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Question <ul>
											<li>Whether the district court erred in denying the motion to disqualify counsel.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Analysis <ul>
											<li>The district court denied the motion to disqualify counsel because there was no substantial relationship between the current matter and a former
												client's matter.</li>
											<li>Whether there is a substantial relationship between a current matter and a former matter is determined by asking whether, during the former
												representation, counsel might have acquired information related to the current matter.</li>
											<li>To answer this question, the trial judge must perform three operations: <ol>
													<li>establish a factual reconstruction of the former representation's scope,</li>
													<li>from that reconstruction, determine whether confidential information allegedly given would have been given to counsel during that
														representation, and</li>
													<li>determine whether that information is relevant to the issues raised in current litigation pending against the former client.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>N.D. Ill. erred in applying this framework. <ul>
													<li>Bigbee prepared mining patents and real estate transactions relating to Gulf's uranium properties.</li>
													<li>It is reasonable to infer that during those representations, Gulf would have given information relating to the actual amount of untapped and
														undeveloped uranium reserves.</li>
													<li>This information is unquestionably relevant to the issues raised in the current litigation, as Gulf's defense depends on it.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>For these reasons, disqualification is required; the decision of N.D. Ill. is reversed.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Conclusion <ul>
											<li>To determine whether a current client matter and a former client matter are substantially related, the following operations are performed: <ol>
													<li>First, determine the former representation's scope through factual reconstruction.</li>
													<li>Second, from that reconstruction, determine whether confidential information would have been given to counsel during that representation.</li>
													<li>Third, determine whether that confidential information is relevant to the issues raised in current litigation pending against the former client.
													</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>If the confidential information is relevant and adverse to the former client, counsel cannot represent the current client.</li>

									<ul>
										<li>Facts <ul>
												<li>In 2003, Tysonia Babineaux was dismissed as the City of Hammond, Lousiana recreation director.</li>
												<li>Babineaux sued the City of Hammond and Mayor Foster ("the City"), for violations of Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII and Louisiana's
													anti-employment discrimination statute.</li>
												<li>Babineaux retained Douglas D. Brown as counsel for her employment discrimination claim.</li>
												<li>Brown had been an assistant city attorney for the City of Hammond during Mayor Foster's predecessor's adminstration, Mayor Louis J. Tallo, which
													ended in 2002.</li>
												<li>The City of Hammond moved to disqualify Brown, as Babineaux had filed a complaint in 2001, and the current subject matter is "similar in all
													respects" to that complaint.</li>
												<li>Moreover, Brown had knowledge of confidential information relating to the 2001 complaint.</li>
												<li>Brown argues that there is not conflict of interest, because all of the events giving rise to the current complaint occurred after he left the City
													of Hammond Attorney's office.</li>

										</li>
										<li>Question <ul>
												<li>Whether a former government lawyer may represent a client in a current matter whose events arose after the lawyer left government employment, even
													if the current matter is substantially similar to a former matter that arose during the lawyer's government employment.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Analysis <ul>
												<li>The comments of ABA Model Rule 1.11, on which Lousiana's professional conduct rule is based, states that a former government lawyer is disqualified
													only from particular matters in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially.</li>
												<li>Former government lawyers are provided more lenient standards because for governments to gain good, young lawyers, they cannot prevent their lawyers
													from gaining non-government employment after devoting time to public service.</li>
												<li>A lawyer has not "personally and substantially participated" in a matter if she is only "tenously and nominally" connected to the matter. <cite>See
														Hernandez v. Johnson<span>, 108 F.3d 554 (5th Cir. 1997).</span></cite></li>
												<li>E.D. Wis. disqualified a former Assistant U.S. Attorney from representing a criminal defendant where the attorney (1) was currently defending a
													client on the same charge that he was previously assigned to prosecute; (2) had received and reviewed investigative reports in connection with the
													prosecution; and (3) had previously discussed the matter with the head law enforcement agent directing the investigation and arrest. <cite>See
														United States v. Clark<span>, 333 F. Supp. 2d 789 (E.D. Wis. 2004).</span></cite></li>
												<li>D.D.C. disqualifed a former FDA attorney from representing a tobacco company after the government produced timesheets indicating that the attorney
													had logged 382 hours on substantially-related litigation. <cite>See United States v. Phillip Morris, Inc.<span>, 312 F. Supp. 2d 27 (D.D.C.
															2004).</span></cite>
												<li>Here, Brown's only involvement in the 2001 matter was that he was copied on a letter from Mayor Tallo containing her "confidential" response to

																<li>Seidler, however, was an Assistant State's Attorney for Lake County before joining Rudnick.</li>

														<li>Question <ul>
																<li>Is a law firm disqualified from representing a client in a matter where one of their associates was formerly employed by the adverse
																	party?</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>Analysis <ul>
																<li>Seidler is clearly disqualified from representing LaSalle.</li>
																<li>The remaining question is whether the law firm, Rudnick, is disqualified entirely from representing LaSalle.</li>
																<li>Knowledge possessed by one attorney in a law firm is presumed to be shared with the firm's other attorneys.</li>
																<li>But, that presumption may be rebutted by establishing that the "infected" attorney was "screened," or insulated, from all
																	participation in, and information about, a case.</li>
																<li>If this is successfully established, the law firm is not entirely disqualified based on the prior employment of a member.</li>
																<li>This rebuttal is permitted because if past government employment results in automatic disqualification of future employers from
																	representing clients adverse to the former government employer, government attorneys would likely become the "Typhoid Marys" of the
																	private sector.</li>
																<li>Sufficient screening may be done in various ways: <ul>
																		<li>Denying the lawyer files, profits, and fees connected with the matter;</li>
																		<li>Prohibiting discussion of the matter in the lawyer's presence;</li>
																		<li>Prohibiting all other lawyers in the firm from showing the lawyer documents related to the matter;</li>
																		<li>Files connected to the matter were kept in a locked cabinet, with its keys held by partners and issued only on a "need to
																			know" basis;</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>However, in all cases were screening was sufficient, the screening procedure was in place either before, or at the time, the
																	disqualifying event occurred. </li>
																<li>Here, Rudnick's screening procedure was not in place until the disqualification motion was filed.</li>
																<li>Therefore, there was no sufficient screening, and the entire firm is disqualified from representation.</li>
																<li>The district court's decision is <em>affirmed</em>.</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>Conclusion <ul>
																<li>Knowledge possessed by a disqualified attorney in a law firm is presumed to be shared with the firm's other attorneys, but that

															new law firm completely disqualified from representing their client?</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Analysis <ul>
														<li>If an attorney is disqualified from representation because of acquiring confidential client information at a former law firm, the
															presumption that the entirety of the attorney's current law firm must be disqualified may be rebutted.</li>
														<li>To successfully rebut the presumption, it must be established that information acquired by the disqualified lawyer is unlikely to be
															significant or material to the litigation.</li>
														<li>Whether the disqualified attorney possesses significant or material information is determined by assessing the case's facts. <ul>
																<li>If the disqualified attorney formerly worked in a small law firm characterized by informality and conductive to "constant
																	cross-pollination" and a "cross current of discussion and ideas" among all of the firm's attorneys on all matters, there is a
																	greater likelihood of acquiring material client confidences.</li>
																<li>If the disqualified attorney formerly worked in a law firm whose offices are not physically isolated and files are made open and
																	available to all lawyers, there will be a greater likelihood of acquiring material client confidences.</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>Additionally, to successfully rebut the presumption, the law firm must provide adequate screening measures to separate the disqualified
															lawyer and eliminate any involvement by that lawyer in the representation.</li>
														<li>Here, Arnold played an appreciable role in the current matter while at Weg, and possessed information material or signficant to the current
															matter.</li>
														<li>Failing to meet this first requirement, it is inconsequential that Thurm erected screening procedures.</li>
														<li>The appellate court's decision is <em>reversed</em>, and disqualification is required.</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Conclusion <ul>
														<li>If an attorney associated with a law firm representing one party leaves her law firm and joins the adverse party's retained law firm, the
															adverse party's retained law firm is presumed to be disqualified from continuing representation. However, that presumption may be rebutted,
															but only if: (a) the law firm establishes that the disqualified attorney does not possess information material or significant to the current
															matter, and (b) the law firm provides adequate screening measures preventing the disqualified lawyer from any involvement in the
															representation.</li>

																		</li>
																		<li>Second, there was a conflict of interest between the officers who first arrived on scene, and the officers who arrived

																			officers follow that officer's instructions.</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>Sanford then argued that MCV's counsel could not represent all of the MCV plaintiffs. <ul>
																		<li>First, there is a conflict of interest between Dr. Meguid, an MCV plaintiff, and the other MCV plaintiffs, because some of
																			counsel's expert witnesses will provide testimony against Dr. Meguid's assertions.</li>

												<summary><i>Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, LLP v. J-M Manufacturing Co.</i>, 6 Cal. 5th 59 (2019)</summary>
												<ul>
													<li>Facts <ul>
															<li>Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, LLP ("Sheppard") represented J-M Manufacturing Co. ("J-M") in a federal <i>qui tam</i> action,
																brought on behalf of several public entities, one of which includes South Tahoe Public Utility District ("South Tahoe"). <ul>
																	<li>Note: A <i>qui tam</i> action (also called a "popular action") is a lawsuit where a private party, called a <i>relator</i>,
																		files a lawsuit on the government's behalf. The government, not the relator, is the real plaintiff, and if the government
																		succeeds, the relator receives a share of the award.</li>
																</ul>
															</li>
															<li>J-M and South Tahoe entered into an agreements with Sheppard consenting to waive all current and future conflicts of interest, but the
																agreements did not refer to a specific conflict.</li>
															<li>Sheppard, however, was also representing South Tahoe on certain employment matters.</li>
															<li>Upon discovering Sheppard's concurrent representation, South Tahoe moved to disqualify Sheppard from the action. The motion was granted.
															</li>
															<li>After the lawsuit concluded, J-M sought a disgorgement of Sheppard's fees. The dispute which was sent to arbitration.</li>
															<li>The arbitrators ruled that Sheppard's failure to disclose its concurrent was not so egregious or serious to warrant a disgorgement of
																fees.</li>
															<li>The superior court confirmed the decision, but the Court of Appeal reversed, finding that Sheppard's undisclosed conflict of interest
																violated the rules of professional conduct, and as such, nullified the parties' consent agreement, including its arbitration clause.
															</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li>Question <ul>
															<li>Whether an undisclosed conflict of interest nullifies an agreement consenting to all future conflicts of interest.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li>Analysis <ul>
															<li>Under the California Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer cannot, without the informed written consent of each client, represent a
																client in a matter and at the same time, in a separate matter, accept another client whose interest in the first matter is adverse to
																the client in the first matter. Cal. R. Prof. Conduct 3-310(C)(3).</li>
															<li>At the time Sheppard entered into the the conflict waiver agreement, Sheppard had an existing conflict of interest by representing both
																J-M and South Tahoe.</li>
															<li>Further, Sheppard knew of this conflict of interest, but did not inform either J-M or South Tahoe of its existence. As such, neither J-M
																nor South Tahoe gave "informed" consent.</li>
															<li>Additionally, upon its discovery of the conflict, South Tahoe revoked is consent, rendering the conflict waiver agreement unenforceable.
															</li>
															<li>The issue, however, is that the conflict waiver agreement covered both future and current conflicts of interest.</li>
															<li>The question then, is, whether the conflict waiver agreement consituted effective consent.</li>
															<li>The purpose of requiring effective consent is to enforce the attorney's duty of loyalty.</li>
															<li>Following this purpose, for a client to give effective consent, her counsel must disclose all material facts, which include existing
																conflicts of interest.</li>
															<li>Thus, by failing to disclose to J-M of a current conflict of interest, Sheppard failed to disclose to its client all material facts.
															</li>
															<li>The Court of Appeal's judgment is affirmed, insofar as it reversed the superior court's judgment regarding the arbitration award. The
																Court of Appeal's judgment ordering disgorgement of all fees collected is reversed and remanded.</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<li>Conclusion <ul>
															<li>For a client's consent to waive all current and future conflicts of interest to be effective, client's counsel must disclose all

				<h3>The Lawyer's Duties to Tribunals</h3>
				<div id="tribunal-duties-intro">
					<p class="h7">Introduction</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lawyers are officers of the court, and as such, owe duties both their clients and the judiciary.</li>
						<li>Because of a lawyers duties to the justice system, there are limits on representation.</li>
						<li>To remain within those limits, the lawyer must: <ul>
								<li>avoid identifying too closely with their clients; and</li>
								<li>communicate openly and fully with their clients about the limitations of representation.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>This section explores the limitations of representation because of a lawyer's duties to the judiciary.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="meritorious-claims">
					<h5>Not All Lawsuits Can Be Filed</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>A lawyer is prohibited from bringing or defending a proceeding with no basis in law and fact. <cite>See <span class="modr">Model Rules of Pr. Conduct</span><span> r.
									3.1.</span></cite></li>
						<li>This rule is supported by FRCP 11, which requires that all papers filed with a court must be signed by the lawyer, certifying that the lawsuit is based in law and fact
							(i.e., "nonfrivolous"). <cite>See <span class="modr">Fed. R. Civ. P.</span><span> 11.</span></cite></li>
						<li>If a lawyer violates FRCP 11, sanctions are imposed. <cite>Id.</cite></li>
						<h6>When Is a Lawsuit Nonfrivolous?</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>To be nonfrivolous, in bringing the lawsuit, the lawyer must be able to make good faith arguments in support of their clients' positions. <cite>See <span
										  class="modr">Model Rules of Pr. Conduct</span><span> r. 3.1, cmt. 2.</span></cite></li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div id="false-testimony">
					<h5>Not All Evidence Can Be Presented in Court</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Once a lawyer has filed a case in court, the lawyer: <ul>
								<li>must not undermine the adjudicative process's integrity; and</li>
								<li>must knowingly present false testimony; and</li>
								<li>if false testimony is presented, must correct such testimony.</li>
								<li><cite><span class="modr">Model Rules of Pr. Conduct</span><span> r. 3.3, cmt. 2.</span></cite></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Furthermore, if the lawyer knows of legal authority directly adverse to her client's position, she must disclose such authority to the court if not already already
							disclosed by opposing counsel. <cite>See <span class="modr">Model Rules of Pr. Conduct</span><span> r. 3.3(a)(2).</span></cite></li>
						<li>This means that a legal argument based on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty toward a tribunal. <cite>See <span class="modr"> Model Rules of Pr.
									Conduct</span><span> r. 3.3, cmt. 4.</span></cite></li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Duty of Candor</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>These rules imply a <em>duty of candor</em>, which implies the following restrictions on representation: <ul>
								<li>A lawyer must not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3(a)(1).</span></cite></li>
								<li>If a lawyer makes a false statement of fact or law, she must correct it. <cite>Id.</cite></li>
								<li>A lawyer must not offer false evidence. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3(a)(3).</span></cite></li>
								<li>If a lawyer, the lawyer's client, or a witness for the client presents false evidence, the lawyer must disclose it to the tribunal and correct it. <cite>Id.</cite>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h6>Duty of Rectification</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>They also imply a <em>duty of rectification</em>, which implies the following restrictions on representation: <ul>
								<li>If a lawyer knows that her client has, is, or will engage(d) in criminal or fraudulent conduct, the lawyer must take remedial measures, and, if necessary, disclose
									such knowledge to the tribunal. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule </span><span>3.3(b).</span></cite></li>
							</ul>
							<p class="h7">What Constitutes Fraudulent Conduct?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fraudulent conduct includes doing any of the following: <ul>
										<li>bribing, intimidating, or unlawfully communicating with, a participant in a proceeding;</li>
										<li>unlawfully destroying or concealing documents or other evidence;</li>
										<li>failing to disclose information to the tribunal when legally required.</li>
										<li><cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3, cmt. 12.</span></cite></li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="h7">What Constitutes Remedial Measures?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A lawyer takes remedial measures if she does the following: <ul>
										<li>The lawyer speaks with the client, advising him of her duty of candor, and seeking his cooperation with withdrawing or correcting false statements or
											evidence. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3, cmt. 10.</span></cite></li>
										<li>If that fails, the lawyer must withdraw from representation, but only if it is permitted and will undo the effect of the false statement or evidence.
											<cite>Id.</cite></li>
										<li>If the lawyer cannot withdraw from represenation, she must disclose the client's actions to the tribunal as is reasonably necessary to remedy the situation,
											even if doing so requires the lawyer to reveal confidential information. <cite>Id.</cite></li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Once a disclosure is made, the rest of the situation is left to the tribunal to decide. <cite>Id.</cite></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="h7">Limitations on the Duties</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Note that the rules regarding false testimony apply only if the lawyer <em>knows</em> the testimony to be false. A lawyer's reasonable belief that evidence is false does
							not prohibit her from presenting to a tribunal. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3, cmt. 7.</span></cite></li>
						<li>A lawyer's knowledge, however, can be inferred from the circumstances. <cite>See <span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 1.0(f).</span></cite></li>
						<li>Thus, if, and only if, a lawyer reasonably <em>believes</em> that such testimony might not be false, the lawyer is permitted to present such testimony, and, if the client
							wishes to present such testimony, <em>must</em> respect the client's wishes. <cite><span class="modr">Model Rule</span><span> 3.3, cmt. 9.</span></cite></li>

										<p class="h10">Facts</p>
										<ul>
											<li>In 2015, the United States filed a criminal complaint against Silver, then-speaker of the New York Assembly, for fraud, conspiracy, and extortion,
												gaining national publicity.</li>
											<li>Warrant issued, Silver was arrested.</li>
											<li>After posting bail, Silver issued a short press statement, and later that day, the U.S. attorney for S.D.N.Y. did the same, commenting that the central
												allegation to the case was that "Silver successfully sought ways to monetize his public office and that he did so in violation of federal law."</li>
											<li>The U.S. attorney went further, issuing a press release, commenting on a connection between Silver's charges and a broader "culture of corruption."</li>
											<li>The U.S. attorney then went on Twitter, stating that Silver monetized on his position as speaker.</li>
											<li>Then even more: the U.S. attorney went on MSNBC and made further comments about the problems caused by corruption.</li>
											<li>A grand jury then returned with an indictment charging Silver with fraud and extortion.</li>
											<li>Silver filed a motion claiming that, through his conduct, the U.S. attorney caused prejudice, and as remedy, the Court must dismiss the indictment or
												poll the grand jury and disclose its minutes.</li>
										</ul>
										<p class="h10">Question</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Whether the prosecutor's extrajudicial comments were (a) sufficently prejudicial to overcome a grand jury proceeding's presumption of regularity, and
												(b) warrant the extreme sanction of dismissing the indictment or polling the grand jury and disclosing its minutes.</li>
										</ul>
										<p class="h10">Analysis</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Dismissal of an indictment because of a defect in the grand jury proceedings is a drastic remedy rarely used.</li>
											<li>A prosecutor's violation of disciplinary or ethical rules alone is insufficient to dismiss an indictment.</li>
											<li>The dismissal of an indictment for non-constitutional error may be appropriate if (a) the violation substantially influenced the grand jury's decision
												to indict, or (b) there is "grave doubt" that the decision was free from the violation's substantial influence.</li>
											<li>Here, there was already substantial publicity surrounding Silver before the prosecutor even made the comments.</li>
											<li>If the prosecutor leaked stories to the media, they were only as prejudicial as the publicity already in place.</li>
											<li>The prosecutor's comments, however, were inappropriate.</li>
											<li>But, inappropriate they may be, they are insufficient for dismissing an indictment.</li>
											<li>Furthermore, Silver has failed to demonstrate a particularized need that outweighs the grand jury proceeding's presumption of secrecy.</li>
											<li>For these reasons, Silver's motion is denied.</li>

										<p class="h8">Facts</p>
										<ul>
											<li>In December 11, 1990, mob boss John Gotti was arrested and charged.</li>
											<li>Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney assigned to the matter, publicly stated that Gotti was a "murderer" and boasted about the government's evidence.</li>
											<li>Bruce Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, waged a publicity campaign, denying that Gotti was a mob boss.</li>
											<li>E.D.N.Y. found both attorneys' extrajudicial statements in violation of Local Rule 7, which prohibits certain extrajudicial statements.</li>
											<li>Despite this finding, Cutler continued the publicity campaign.</li>
											<li>E.D.N.Y. found Cutler guilty of criminal contempt, and sentenced him to 90 days house arrest, 3 years probation, and suspended his practice license in
												E.D.N.Y. for 180 days. </li>
											<li>Cutler appealed to the 2d Cir., arguing that Local Rule 7 was unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment.</li>
										</ul>
										<p class="h8">Question</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Whether Local Rule 7, prohibiting certain extrajudicial statements, is unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment.</li>
										</ul>
										<p class="h8">Analysis</p>
										<ul>
											<li>To hold a defendant in criminal contempt, the government must prove beyond reasonable doubt that: <ol>
													<li>the court entered a reasonably specific order;</li>
													<li>the defendant knew of that order;</li>
													<li>the defendant violated that order; and</li>
													<li>the defendant's violation was willful.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>Here, Cutler was on notice to follow definite and specific orders by the judge, so the first two requirements are met.</li>
											<li>For the third requirement, Cutler argues that the: <ul>
													<li>even if his comments were prohibited by Rule 7, they are prohibited only they are reasonably likely to prejudice the proceedings, and</li>
													<li>none of the comments he made were reasonably likely to prejudice the proceedings.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>The Court rejects the second argument, but considers the first.</li>
											<li>A rule prohibiting certain types of speech from an attorney is valid only if the speech is reasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial or otherwise
												prejudice the administration of justice.</li>
											<li>Furthermore, there is a strong, but rebuttable, presumption that speech falling within the categories of Local Rule 7 are reasonably likely to interfere
												with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the administration of justice.</li>
											<li>Here, the district court made findings of fact under the assumption that the reasonable likelihood standard applied. For this reason, the Court will not
												disturb the district court's judgment.</li>
											<li>Therfore, the third requirement is met.</li>
											<li>With respect to the fourth requirement, Cutler argues: <ul>
													<li>he did not know the comments listed in the order to show cause were reasonably likely to prejudice the proceedings.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Attorneys are held to a higher standard than lay persons, and his persistent attempts to try Gotti's case in the court of public opinion, despite the
												judge's warnings, belie any notion that he did not intend to disregard the orders.</li>
											<li>The district court's judgment is affirmed.</li>

											<li>On August 15, 2007, Jones, a public defender, was appointed to represent Jordan Scott on a misdemeanor assault charge.</li>
											<li>Scott's trial was set for the following the day.</li>
											<li>On the morning of the trial, Jones spoke with Scott for twenty minutes, and voiced concerns to the judge that he would not be effective as defense
												counsel because he needed more time to interview witnesses.</li>
											<li>The judge replied that the witnesses were present, and that trial would proceed after lunch.</li>
											<li>After lunch, the trial court reconvened, and trial proceeded.</li>
											<li>Scott attempted to raise a pretrial motion, and the judge asked if he was ready to start trial.</li>
											<li>Scott replied no, because he had no opportunity to interview witnesses, to which the judge warned him that if Scott did not proceed with trial, he would

										<ul>
											<li>Contempt is an act or omissions that substantially disrupts the judicial process in a case (e.g., disobeying a court order, disrespecting the

											<li>Reviewing a finding of contempt, the standard is: abuse of discretion.</li>
											<li>An error of law alone is insufficient to establish abuse of discretion; the trial court's decision must imply an unreasonable, arbitrary, or

											<li>Under Ohio's Code of Professional Conduct, defense attorneys should not be required to violate their duties to their client. Thus, a trial court may
												commit an error if it holds defense counsel in contempt for refusing to proceed (i.e., disobeying its order denying continuance), while defense counsel
												fears that proceeding would result in ineffective assistance.</li>
											<li>Here, the facts show that a continuance was warranted. <ul>
													<li>While defense counsel did not request a specific time extension, completely denying continuance was an abuse of discretion.</li>
													<li>Any inconvenience to the judiciary for granting a continuance would have been minimal compared to the judge's proposal that this court reverse
														his decision.</li>
													<li>Furthermore, defense counsel had legitimate reasons for requesting continuance—he only had two hours to study the facts, the witnesses, and his
														client, before preparing and constructing a defense.</li>

								knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. The fact that the client had not paid his bill is no excuse—as long as an
								attorney-relationship exists, an attorney has a non-waivable obligation to provide competent representation per Rule 1.1, and a duty to provide diligent representation,
								per Rule 1.3. Moreover, the fact that the client did not suffer any harm does not excuse these duties, since Rule 1.1 does not include a harm exception or requirement.

						<ul>
							<li>A law firm associate, $x$, has been asked by a partner to represent client $y$ in a implied warranty of habitability claim against $y$'s landlord.</li>
							<li>$x$ interviews $y$ for more details, and $y$ told $x$ that the landlord was shooting invisible but dangerous gamma rays into the apartment.</li>
							<li>$y$ had no scientific evidence for the contention, and further told $x$ that as long as the gamma ray shots continued, he would not pay rent, even if it means eviction
								or becoming homeless.</li>
							<li>$x$ has tried persuading $y$ that he is mistaken, and has advised him to pay rent.</li>
							<li>After $y$ angrily rejected $x$'s conveyances, $x$ has: <ul>
									<li>asked the court's permission to withdraw representation of $y$,</li>
									<li>consulted with $y$'s out-of-state daughter and sharing the information he has learned, and</li>
									<li>prepared to file an action seeking appointment of a guardien for $y$ if necessary.</li>

						<p class="h10">Question</p>

							<li>Was $x$'s conduct proper?</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="h10">Analysis</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Yes. All of the $x$'s conduct was taken to protect a client with diminished capacity from foreseeable harm. $x$ is entitled to do so, and in fact, he may even be
								required. While an attorney is not permitted to divulve a client's confidential information, Rule 1.14 states that if a client suffers from diminished capacity, a
								lawyer need not comply with the duty of confidentiality in order to comply with Rule 1.14. The same goes for the lawyer's duty of loyalty to her client. The key point
								is, when handling a client with diminished capacity, the rules are entirely different.</li>

								extensive labor is performed. <cite>See <span>Wisconsin Ethics Opinion E-93-4.</span></cite> Here, it is unlikely that $x$ was precluded from accepting other
								representation, nor is it likely that $x$'s representation would result in $y$'s immediate benefit. So, in a jurisdiction like Wisconsin, $x$ would be subject to

							<li>Attorney $x$ agreed to represent plaintiff $y$ in a personal injury matter.</li>
							<li>Orignally, both $x$ and $y$ agreed to a 30% contingent fee, which was a reasonable fee for the type of cases that $x$ handled.</li>
							<li>1 year into litigation, $x$ grew increasingly busy, and there was a long waitlist of potential clients.</li>
							<li>Accordingly, $x$ raised his standard fee to a 35% contingent fee; a reasonable fee.</li>
							<li>$x$ and $y$'s agreement was silent on the possibility of a fee increase.</li>
							<li>To that end, $x$ approached $y$, and proposed modifying the contingent fee percentage from 30% to 35%.</li>
							<li>$x$ explained that if $y$ did not agree, $x$ would withdraw representation and find $y$ another experienced personal injury attorney charging at the original fee.</li>
							<li>$y$ reluctantly agreed to modify the fee agreement, as proposed.</li>
							<li>Thereafter, $y$'s case was settled.</li>

							<li>As a result, $x$ sued $y$ to recover the agreed modified contingent fee.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="h10">Question</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Is $x$ likely to prevail?</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="h10">Analysis</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To recover the modified contingent fee, an attorney must show that "the client was not pressured to accede in order to avoid the problems of changing counsel,
								alienating the lawyer, missing a deadline or losing a significant opportunity in the matter, or because a new lawyer would have to repeat significant work for which the
								client owned or had paid the first lawyer." In other words, "the lawyer must show that a reasonable client might have chosen to accept the late contract, typically
								because it benefited the client in some substantial way (other than by relieving the client from having to find a new lawyer)." <cite><span>Rest. § 18, cmt.
										e.</span></cite> Furthermore, while periodic incremental increases in a lawyer's regularly hourly billing rates are generally permissible, such increases must
								be (a) communicated clearly to, and accepted by, the client at the beginning of the client-lawyer relationship, and (b) reasonable under the circumstances.
								Modifications sought by a lawyer that change the basic nature of a fee arrangement or significantly increase the lawyer's compensation absent an unanticipated change in
								circumstances ordinarily will be unreasonable. <cite>See <span>ABA Formal Opinion 11-458.</span></cite> Here, it is unlikely for $x$ to recover the contingent fee,
								because the possibility of increases was not communicated to the client at the beginning of the attorney-client relationship. Furthermore, it is likely that the lawyer
								knew, or should have known, that his client waitlist was going to grow longer.</li>

							<li>Yes. Under Rule 1.15, advanced fees paid by a client must remain in a trust account until the lawyer actually earns the fees or expenses are incurred. $x$ absolutely
								cannot transfer funds in $y$'s trust account until she earns those fees. While lawyers are permitted to use client funds for business expenses, they are permitted to do

							<li>No. Under the crime-fraud exception, privilege does not apply to a communication if the communication was made with the intent to further an ongoing or future crime or
								fraud, even if the lawyer is unaware of the client's intent. <cite><span>Rest. § 82(b).</span></cite></li>

						<summary>Illustration: Attorney-Client Privilege VIII</summary>
						<p class="bhead">Facts</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Medium sized law firm $x$ represents a difficult client, $y$.</li>
							<li>Since the representation began, $y$ has complained about $z$'s, a lawyer at $y$, services, and is now stating that $y$ will not pay any more fees, but expects $x$ to
								finish the case and will probably sue $x$ when the case concludes.</li>
							<li>$z$ frequently speaks with $w$, $x$'s informal ethics counsel, about how to deal with $y$.</li>
							<li>$x$ decides to withdraw representation, to which $y$ sues and demands production of all communications between $z$ and $w$.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="bhead">Question</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Are the communications between $z$ and $w$ privileged?</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="bhead">Analysis</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It depends on the jurisdiction. In jurisdictions like New York, there is such a thing as intra-firm privilege, which functions much like attorney-client privilege.
